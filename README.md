# hack-kitchen-s21
A repository for hack kitchen by team bergers!


<b>Challenge 1: Made a quick website using react and flask to use as many ingredients as possible</b>
<br>
Its a clickable website inspired off of Nickelodeon's meaturduckbalizza, called garegguckenizza - garlic, egg, duck, chicken and pizza
<br>
(with an easter egg of Eugene singing)
<br>
We attempted to implement login, but couldn't do it in the 2.5 hour time limit we had



<b>Challenge 2: Made another quick website for "Build your own restaurant" using react<b>
<br>
We named our restaurant off the first challenge -  calling it garegguckenizza.<br>
It has limited ingredients, but the combinations truly make it special - see if you can make meaturduckballizza!<br>
(click on our name for a surprise!)
