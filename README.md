# hack-kitchen-s21
A repository for hack kitchen by team bergers!


Challenge 1: Made a quick website using react and flask
Its a clickable website inspired off of Nickelodeon's meaturduckbalizza, called garegguckenizza - garlic, egg, duck, chicken and pizza
(with an easter egg of Eugene singing)
We attempted to implement login, but couldn't do it in the 2.5 hour time limit we had
